                       Introduction to Acmeism
  
  I beg you be logical in the design and structure of your work,
  in syntax . . . be a skillful builder, both in small things and
  in the whole . . .  love words, as Flaubert did, exercise
  economy in your means, thrift in the use of words, precision and
  authenticity--then you will discover the secret of a wonderful
  thing: beauty clarity.
                                          --Mikhail Kuzmin, 1910
  
      &quot;Acmeism&quot; was a short lived Russian poetry movement
      from a century ago.
