                     Project Status and Roadmap
     
     * TestML development is a highly iterative process
     * Specification, Design, Implementation and Testing all at once
     * Probably 3 months until 1.0 release
     ** Designed and intended to be released often
     ** But need to get first release fully baked
     
     * Add to real world projects
     * Make changes to specs
     * Propagate out through implementations
     * Rinse, Lather, Repeat
